# Mitron Bank Credit Card Strategy Insights Project - Power BI
Provide Insights to the Product Strategy Team in the Banking Domain

## Problem Statement
**Mitron Bank** is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 

**AtliQ Data Services** came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details. 

Peter Pandey is a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services and was asked by his manager to take over this project. His role is to analyse the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends. 

The successful acquisition of this project depends on Peter's ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations and impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his team. Peter requested support from his manager Tony Sharma, and he provided him with some ideas to generate insights based on the data provided. 

## Task List:

3. Present your insights to Mr. Bashnir Rover & team. Be creative and concise with your presentation.
4. Use your dashboard in the presentation along with the deck.
5. Use additional data based on your own research to support your recommendations.
